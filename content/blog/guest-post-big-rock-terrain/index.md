I followed Jeremy from Black Magic Craft's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjZmihU7nxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video on making rocks</a>. I didn't capture the first steps, but I started out by using tacky glue to glue large pieces of 2 inch thick XPS foam on top of each other. I let them sit for a few days with weights on top to make sure they didn't shift. It takes a few days for the glue to set up because the insulation is a vapor barrier (or something like that).

Next I took the slabs and cut out the raw shapes on the hot wire table. I erred on the side of larger pieces because I remove more material in the next step. 

In the pictures below I used sculpting tools and an Olfa utility knife to add texture to the rocks. The Olfa knife texture method is also from BMC, in his video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaDLkRQOhyM&t=232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">making scenic tree bases</a>. I used this for the top edges of the rocks. One thing to look out for in this step is to keep the glue seam hidden which was something I didn't do all that well. For some of the pieces I left the hotwire texture toward the bottom of the piece to hopefully simulate smooth cave walls to give the rocks versatility. You'll want a shop vac on hand because this is very messy.

Following the BMC method I applied watered down joint compound to the pieces. During this step you can use the joint compound to cover up any glue seams you missed or had a hard time removing in the previous step. After the compound was applied I took an old cheap paintbrush (I recomend a 1-2 inch brush) and added horizontal lines to the rocks to give additional texture.

Next I applied the BMC mod podge/black paint base layer and gave all the pieces a coat of tan paint.

I mixed tan and yellow for the first drybrush layer. Following Jeremy's instructions I applied it a little heavy, since a lot of it will get covered up.

I didnt have any burnt sienna, so I used similar colors to stipple on the rocks to make them look more realistic. I also stippled a teal color on as well.

Then I did a moderate drybrush of Tan to give the piece depth, followed by a lighter drybrush of Suede, and finally a very light drybrush of Vanilla.

For the final step I applied a black wash to every piece. Then as soon as I finished the last piece I took my black wash and mixed in some metallic paint. I had gold and silver on hand so I used that. Before the pieces dried, I applied a second coat of the same black wash with the metallic paint added. This will add a slight reflective/shiny texture to the final coat of the rocks, which will make them look more realistic. I didn't mix my metallic paint in very well with the wash and some of it clumped up on the rocks, but overall I don't think it turned out too bad.

The double black wash is also the reason I used a tan base coat instead of grey. I didn't want the rocks to turn out too dark.

And that's it, here are some photos of the final pieces.
