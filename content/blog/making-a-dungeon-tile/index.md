These dungeon tiles are brown to match the cavern tiles in our [cave tile set](../cave-tile-system). Each side is either 2, 4, or 6 inches long. In this post I'll be going through how to make a 2x6-inch tile.

Starting out, we need a 2x6-inch rectangle of XPS foam. I've made small marks with a pen at every inch along the sides, as guides for cutting the grooves.

![initial](initial.jpg)

The grid is made by cutting grooves between the individual tiles in the piece. This can be done with nothing more than a ballpoint pen or a pencil, using the tip to "draw" in the indentations and then going over them heavily to widen them, but I like the wider and deeper lines that I can get with a hot wire cutter.

![grooves-1](grooves-1.jpg)

By briefly touching the side of the foam to the wire, I can melt away a nice big grout line. The depth and the width of the groove will vary based on the heat setting, how far into the foam you go, and how quickly you move in and out.

Continuing the grooves down the sides adds a lot to the overall look of the piece.

This is what we have after making all the crosswise gridlines.

Unfortunately, the wire cutter is just barely too short to make the grooves along the length.

![too-tall](too-tall.jpg)

So we're just going to cut the whole thing in half, then put it back together after we melt the rest of the grooves in. You can of course just make smaller tiles if you have this problem, but I preferred to stick to my 2-4-6 inch form factor, and not have quite so many small tiles.

There are a couple ways I have made this cut: the first way was to cut right down the center of the middle groove. I did this with most of the tiles I had to cut like this, and the resulting seam after putting it back together is not very noticeable.

This is the other way I wanted to try, going right along the edge of the groove instead of down the middle. I thought having the seam at a transition point would reduce the visibility of it.

Anyway, this is what we have after the cut.

![cut-in-half](cut-in-half.jpg)

Two pieces that will fit nicely.

Now we can stick them back together.

For a little added stability I'm putting a piece of toothpick inside.

![putting-together-1](putting-together-1.jpg)

Looking at this much later I realize that piece of toothpick is woefully short. Still, they're probably not useless.

I poke a hole in one side, stick the piece of toothpick in, then line it up with the other half, using the toothpick to make an indentation where I'll poke the other hole.

![putting-together-2](putting-together-2.jpg)

Then I remove the toothpick, fill the hole with some white glue (I used tacky glue, regular old PVA glue is also fine) and put in the toothpick. Then I cover everything with more glue like so:

![glue](glue.jpg)

And then just fit the two halves together and clamp them. I used scrap pieces of foam to protect the ends of the tile from clamp marks. If you've got any glue squeezing out in the middle, now is the time to wipe it off.

![clamp](clamp.jpg)

I left a tub of rocks on top of the tile while it dried to make sure the clamp wasn't causing any bowing upwards or downwards.

![clamp-and-rocks](clamp-and-rocks.jpg)

I usually let these dry for a few hours, but they're probably ready long before that.

Here's the finished seam from our cut:

Now we're ready to start texturing.

![glued](glued.jpg)

First, to round down those sharp edges, we're going to slice them off with an exacto knife.

![cutting-edges](cutting-edges.jpg)

We'll go around all the top outside edges, and down the sides on each corner.

![cut-edges](cut-edges.jpg)

With the exacto knife we're also going to chip off some bits from the edges and corners, and even a few places in the middle of the tiles.

![chipped](chipped.jpg)

Then we'll make some real cracks. You can use a ballpoint pen to carve these in. I like to use this pointy metal end of a compass.

![cracks](cracks.jpg)

Continue the cracks down the sides for the full effect.

![corner-cracks](corner-cracks.jpg)

For some overall texture I grabbed some rocks out of my garden and rolled them all over the surface. This can be a tedious process as you want to use all different sides of the rock so you don't get repeat patterns. Also I found that after a while the foam would partially spring back to its original shape, so I had to try and imprint the rock texture extra hard to retain the detail.

![rock-texturing](rock-texturing.jpg)

Here's a closer look at the texture we got.

![rock-texture-result](rock-texture-result.jpg)

There are still a lot of smooth spots, so we'll go over it with some balled up tinfoil to add a little more roughness overall.

![tinfoil-texture](tinfoil-texture.jpg)

The amount of texturing you do is really up to your preference. I've done some tiles with only rocks, or only foil, or both.

Now the texture is all done, and it's time for paint.

The first coat is mod podge mixed with some of the main base color of paint; in our case, light taupe.

Then a second coat of the same color, without the mod podge. I've found that having mod podge in this second coat makes the wash (which is the next step) not stick very well.
