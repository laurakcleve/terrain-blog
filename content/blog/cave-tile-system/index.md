![Cave Tile System](cave-tile-system.jpg)

For the final dungeon of our first D&D campaign, which we started over a year ago.

This dungeon was meant to be natural caverns with some parts carved and constructed into rooms and passages, so our block-shaped tiles are painted to match the color of the natural stone tiles.

The pieces were shaped to fit this specific dungeon, and we started out with the loose intention of creating the whole thing, but near the end we fell victim to time constraints and burnout and started reusing the tiles we'd already made everywhere we could. It worked out because the whole dungeon was too big to fit on our 6x4-foot table anyway.

The grand total number of pieces made for this set is 123; 63 irregular cave tiles, and 60 square block tiles. Probably too many.

For modularity, each piece's connecting edges are either 2, 4, or 6 inches long.

The pieces can also be combined with different edge lengths.

Each piece has a small screw every two inches along the edges for connecting magnetically. We use 5mm x 1mm magnets in between the screws; this way, we don't have to worry about polarity.

We haven't found a good magnet solution for the square block tiles, because there are no definitive inside edges, so there would always be screws showing around the outside.

To keep track of distance, we added grid markers every inch, trying to keep them fairly subtle.
