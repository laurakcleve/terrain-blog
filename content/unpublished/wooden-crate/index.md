I started with a half inch cube of xps foam, and a super thin little sheet of foam.

![super-thin-foam](super-thin-foam.jpg)

This is probably a little too thin, I think it's about 1/32".

![thin-sliced-foam](thin-sliced-foam.jpg)

Then I sliced up some planks.

![plank-strips-1](plank-strips-1.jpg)

Just whatever width looked good, this is a little less than 1/8" I think.

Tweezers were necessary for every part of moving these guys around. They just fly everywhere.

![plank-strips-2](plank-strips-2.jpg)

I cut them to length, but didn't glue them on yet.

First we need to add some wood plank texture to the underlying box.

![texture-1](texture-1.jpg)

I use the pointy metal end of a compass to kind of draw in the edges of the planks and the wood grain texture. A ballpoint pen or a sharpened pencil also work okay, but I prefer this thing because it's decently sharp without being a perfectly sharp point, and the point widens quickly and helps to define the lines better.

![texture-2](texture-2.jpg)

I made a couple deep lines to outline some boards, then some fainter wavy lines around them to look like the wood grain.

![texture-3](texture-3.jpg)

I did the same wood grain texture on the boards that I had cut out earlier. If I was smart I would have just textured that whole little sheet of foam before cutting it up.

Then the boards get glued on around the edges.

![side-1](side-1.jpg)

I used a toothpick to pick up some glue and spread it around the edges to be more precise.

![all-sides](all-sides.jpg)

I also added a little diagonal cross piece to each of the sides (but not the top and bottom).

![sides-and-top](sides-and-top.jpg)

The top and bottom I only put planks on the edges.

As soon as everything is glued on, it's time to paint.

![paint-color](paint-color.jpg)

I mixed a light taupe and an espresso brown to get my base color, then mixed the paint with some mod podge. (Roughly equal amounts, maybe more mod podge. It doesn't matter too much.)

![base-coat](base-coat.jpg)

After the mod podge coat was dry I went over the whole thing again with just the paint.

![base-coat-2](base-coat-2.jpg)

I then went over everything with a brown wash.

Next I did a light dry brushing with the same brown in the base coat.

![drybrush-1](drybrush-1.jpg)

I have seen some people do a dry brush on wood or stone with pure white, and actually have it look decent, so I had to try it out.

![drybrush-2](drybrush-2.jpg)

I probably got something wrong, it just didn't turn out as well.

To try and fix it I went over the whole thing again with the brown wash.

![wash-2](wash-2.jpg)

I could have called it done at this point, but it was a little too dark overall, and the color too uniform.

I tried to add a little weathering with a lighter brown, and dry brushed in kind of random spots.
