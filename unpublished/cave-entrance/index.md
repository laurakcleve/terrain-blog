Used my compass for its actual purpose

Started slicing off straight-edged chunks with a knife. Freehanding on the hot wire table would have been a disaster for sure, I would have needed some kind of jig or something.

Doing the inside was way more annoying.

Had to do an awful lot of sanding.

The problem with this much sanding was that I didn't keep to the lines very well on the front, and I had no lines at all on the back, so my perfectly round curve got all messed up.

I cut out a little template to stick onto it to try and get my edges back on track.
