I picked out a small scrap to start with.

![starting-scrap](starting-scrap.jpg)

On the hot wire table I cut it to size (about 38mm x 18mm, 4mm thick).

![tabletop-cut](tabletop-cut.jpg)

To make the shape a little more interesting I beveled the edges. Our hot wire cutter has a nice feature that lets you adjust the angle of the wire.

![hot-wire-angle](hot-wire-angle.jpg)

As easy as cutting the bevels is, it's really hard to predict what the dimensions of the resulting surface are going to be, or to cut them to a specific size. So since I didn't know how wide I would need the legs to be beforehand, I measured the width to cut them to afterward.

I started with pieces that were around 3mm thick and 14mm tall.

Both legs cut to size.

![both-legs-cut-to-size](both-legs-cut-to-size.jpg)

For the cutout, I just drew the outline freehand with a pen.

![leg-cutout-outline](leg-cutout-outline.jpg)

And sliced it out with an exacto knife.

![leg-cutout](leg-cutout.jpg)

I used the first leg as a template to trace the outline onto the other leg.

![lining-up-second-leg-cutout](lining-up-second-leg-cutout.jpg)

![legs-cutout](legs-cutout.jpg)

The cuts were pretty rough, so I sanded them down a bit, as well as sanding down the sharp corners and edges of all the pieces, just a little bit. It's easy to take off too much so you really only need a few light swipes.

![sanding](sanding.jpg)

To create the outline of the planks on the tabletop I made some deep lines with my compass tip.

![tabletop-first-lines](tabletop-first-lines.jpg)

And I continued them down the sides and along the underside.

![tabletop-lines-bottom](tabletop-lines-bottom.jpg)

Then I freehanded the rest of the wood grain pattern, not going quite as deep. This is the part that I like to spend the most time on and be really meticulous with. Other commonly used methods would probably work out fine, like using a wire brush, or making less detailed squiggly lines with a pen or pencil, but this is my personal preference.

![top-wood-pattern](top-wood-pattern.jpg)

Here are a few incremental pictures of drawing the wood grain on the underside.

![wood-grain-steps](wood-grain-steps.jpg)

![bottom-wood-pattern](bottom-wood-pattern.jpg)

I continued the patterns down the sides as well.

![side-wood-pattern](side-wood-pattern.jpg)

I did the same work on the legs, a really difficult part given their extreme thinness. I actually carved all the way through on one of them and had to glue it back together.

Once they're all textured it's time to start assembling.

![all-pieces-textured](all-pieces-textured.jpg)

For a little added stability, I cut a few dress pins into some small makeshift dowels.

![pin-dowels](pin-dowels.jpg)

Then I inserted two into each of the top of the leg pieces. This is just a dry fit for now.

![pinned-leg](pinned-leg.jpg)

Checking to make sure they won't poke out the top of the table.

![checking-pin-length](checking-pin-length.jpg)

I used the pin-doweled leg piece to mark the holes in the underside of the tabletop. Eyeballing the right position was really difficult and I spent like 5 minutes trying to get the first one perfect, before just giving up and stabbing it in. 

![tabletop-holes](tabletop-holes.jpg)

Before gluing the leg on I barely remembered to pull the pins out and glue them in first. Then I put more glue all over the top surface of the leg, and on the exposed ends of the pins, and into the tabletop they go.

![glue](glue.jpg)

There's not much here to hold the pieces at a right angle on their own, so it's important to hold the leg straight for a minute or two while the glue sets a bit.

![holding-leg-straight](holding-leg-straight.jpg)

Rinse and repeat for the other leg, and we've got a nice little functioning table.

![assembled](assembled.jpg)

On to painting. For the base color, I mixed together a beige, a tan, and a grey. I didn't keep super accurate measurements, but it was roughly equal parts of each.

![paint-colors](paint-colors.jpg)

![mixed-paint](mixed-paint.jpg)

Then I added some mod podge, and altogether made way more than I needed.

![paint-and-mod-podge](paint-and-mod-podge.jpg)

Here's the first coat.

![first-coat](first-coat.jpg)

And here's the second coat, done with the same color paint, but no mod podge mixed in.

![second-coat](second-coat.jpg)

Once dry, I did a dark brown wash over everything. 

It's definitely an option to call it done at this point, but I wanted to see what I could do taking it a little farther.

![wash](wash.jpg)

With my tan paint, I did a really light drybrushing, focusing on the edges.

![first-drybrush](first-drybrush.jpg)

And then thought 'more is better,' and overdid it.

![first-detailing](first-detailing.jpg)

So I went back over it again with the brown wash to try and tone down the highlights.

![second-wash-selective](second-wash-selective.jpg)

And then tried to add back in a little more of the highlights with the tan, using a very small brush and actually going over the individual grains in various places.

![final-detailing](final-detailing.jpg)

After that I was just kind of stumped on what more I could do, so I called it quits. A lot of work at the end, for a relatively little difference. It's a pretty respectable result though.
