I had a really hard time finding resources for making miniature barrels. 

This is the first attempt, so the process is sort of haphazard.

I apologize in advance for many of the pictures being out of focus. My efforts at trying to be a photographer were not enough to cure the potato-ness of my phone at such a small scale.

I found this papercraft template online. I printed it at two sizes: one to make a 1/2" tall barrel and the other closer to 3/4" high. The first wooden crate I made was 1/2" tall, so I thought, well, might as well just make the barrel the same. I added the 3/4" printout as a backup because 1/2" seemed incredibly small. And it definitely was.

Here's the piece of foam I cut for making the barrel. It's a little less than 1/32" thick, I think. (I really need a metric ruler.)

I put a super thin piece of blue tack on the back of the template to keep it in place.

Using an exacto knife, I cut the foam around the template.

To make it look like the barrel is made out of separate planks of wood, I used my compass tip to draw lines in between each one. With a piece of foam this thin, it's really easy to go straight through, so I had to make them fairly shallow.

And then I made some even more shallow lines running vertically for the wood grain texture. Honestly it felt like the structural integrity of this little scrap of foam was just about destroyed at this point.

From the same starting piece of foam, I used an exacto knife to cut out the circles for the top and bottom of the barrel.

And then I had to figure out how to go about actually assembling this thing. The logical starting point seemed to be forming the main piece into a cylinder. Not thinking ahead, I put a tiny bit of tacky glue on one of the ends, and rolled it up with my fingers to put the ends together. I then realized that I had no hands free to do anything until the glue was set. I sat there holding it precariously together while I racked my brain for some kind of contraption that could hold this tiny thing exactly right. I thought up a lot of really dumb ideas, but in the end I just sat there holding it, and after many long minutes the glue dried enough to hold it together. It took much longer than normal because I got impatient and kept checking it, so it came apart more than once.

Next was to insert the top and bottom of the barrel. I put some glue just on one side of the little circle and fumbled around with tweezers until I got it to stick to one of the planks. My plan was to then just add more glue around the rest of the circle and bend all the tops of the planks in against it.

It didn't go well. I had nothing to hold everything in place well enough. Even trying to smush everything together with my fingers didn't work, because I couldn't keep all eight sides placed just right with four or five of my fingertips.
